##### This technique can be used to for:
1. Optimizing marketing assets.
    - Evaluate images, videos, ads, social media posts, emails, flyers, or any creatives for a campaign or client.

2. Boosting Sales in Retail.
    - Guide the gaze of shoppers and make your products stand out on store shelves, and release highperforming package designs.

3. Building successful websites.
    - Run tests on your website, landing page, and online store to optimize UX, boost CTRs and web applications.

##### The metrics you measure include:
1. Attention
    - Generates heatmaps and fogmaps in an instant to indicate the most attention-grabbing areas in visual assets.

2. Areas of Interest
    - Measure attention to the smallest details on any element of your asset.

3. Images/Video focus
    - Index how large a portion of your asset draws attention. If your image or video has many items that draw attention, people are less likely to focus on any single part of the asset.  - - Higher Focus scores are achieved when a single or only a very few narrow areas draw attention.

4. Cognitive Demand
    - Predict the amount of visual information viewers have to process while looking at your asset. 
    - When images and videos are more complex, they lead to increased perceptual load and thereby more cognitive demand.

5. Clarity 
    - Predict whether customers will experience your asset as clear or not. 
    - A low Clarity score means that customers will experience your design as cluttered and hard to understand.

6. Engagement
    - Predict how excited and immersed your customers will feel when they are exposed to your asset.
    - A high level of Engagement leads to increased brand memory and purchasing behavior.
